# Pallid Sturgeon Stockind assessemtn

## About

This reposititory performs the assessement of model runs with varying stocking scenarios.  The assessment is mostly graphical.  The criteria for USFW psuedoextinction probability is 5% of the runs reach extinction in 50 years, which is the same as for the birds (i.e., plovers and terns).  

## Objectives

1) Graphically plot population dynamics 
2) Dertermine the number of age-0 and age-1 Pallid Sturgeon that need to be stocked to minimize extinction probability
